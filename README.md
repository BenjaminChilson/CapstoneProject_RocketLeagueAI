# CapstoneProject_RocketLeagueAI
## **Project Introduction**
### The Team:
This team is titled *CarBall AI* and they are a team of senior level undergraduate computer
science students at the University of Missouri. They all share an interest in video games and wish to learn more about artificial intelligence. Their goal with this project is to explore various machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms and become more knowledgeable in that area of computer science. To accomplish this they are challenging themselves to create an artificial intelligence that can play the video game Rocket League at an at-minimum low skill level, continually learning and improving its skills through training and experimentation.
